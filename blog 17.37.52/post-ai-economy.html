                    As artificial intelligence reshapes industries and societies, the question of who benefits—and who is left behind—has never been more urgent.

                <h2>The AI Revolution: Opportunity or Disruption?</h2>
                <p>
                    My journey through finance and strategy has given me a front-row seat to the digital transformation sweeping the globe. AI is not just a tool; it's a force multiplier, amplifying productivity, creativity, and—sometimes—inequality. The companies and individuals who harness AI effectively will see exponential gains, while others risk being left behind.
                </p>
                <h2>Winners, Losers, and the New Middle</h2>
                <p>
                    In the post-AI economy, wealth will flow to those who own the algorithms, the data, and the platforms. But there's hope: education, adaptability, and a willingness to learn new skills can help bridge the gap. My own academic path—spanning four countries and five languages—has taught me that reinvention is possible, and that the future belongs to the curious and the resilient.
                </p>
                <h2>Redefining Value</h2>
                <p>
                    As AI automates routine tasks, human value will shift toward creativity, empathy, and strategic thinking. The most successful people will be those who can combine technical fluency with emotional intelligence—who can lead teams, tell stories, and solve problems that machines can't.
                </p>
                <h2>Building a Fairer Future</h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge for policymakers, educators, and business leaders is to ensure that the benefits of AI are widely shared. This means investing in education, supporting lifelong learning, and creating safety nets for those displaced by automation. It also means fostering a culture of inclusion, where diverse voices help shape the algorithms that will define our world.

                <p>
                    <em>The post-AI economy is not predetermined. It's up to us to decide how wealth—and opportunity—will be divided.</em>

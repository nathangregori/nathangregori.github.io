                    <p class="lead">
                        Life rarely follows the path we imagine. My journey from a challenging childhood in Paris to becoming a finance graduate, professional fencer, and AI strategist in Hong Kong is testament to how adversity can become your greatest asset.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Roots of Resilience</h2>
                    <p>
                        The story begins in Paris, where I was born to a French father and Vietnamese mother. My early years were marked by circumstances that no child should face. Family instability, financial hardship, and the feeling of being caught between cultures created a perfect storm that could have easily derailed my future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By age 13, I had developed a fierce independence—not by choice, but by necessity. I learned to navigate complex situations, advocate for myself, and find opportunities where others saw none. These challenges forced me to build emotional intelligence, strategic thinking, and the hunger for a different life.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Trauma creates change you don't choose. Healing creates change you do choose."
                        <cite>— Michelle Rosenthal</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>Finding Fencing: The Art of Strategic Combat</h2>
                    <p>
                        My introduction to fencing at 15 was transformative. The discipline required focus, strategic thinking, and precise execution—skills that would later prove invaluable in business and finance. Every match was a psychological battle, teaching me to read opponents, anticipate moves, and maintain composure under pressure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within three years, I competed at the national level, eventually participating in eight World Cups and earning medals for France. Fencing taught me that success isn't just about raw talent but about methodical practice, mental resilience, and learning from every defeat.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>The Academic Breakthrough</h2>
                    <p>
                        Despite the limitations of my circumstances, I excelled academically, driven by a growing understanding that education was my path to freedom. My application to City University of Hong Kong was a leap of faith—a chance to reinvent myself half a world away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the scholarship offer arrived, covering over $93,000 in education expenses, it validated years of quiet persistence. Moving to Hong Kong at 18, I encountered cultural shock, language barriers, and the profound loneliness of being far from home. Yet the distance also provided perspective and healing.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Building on Trauma's Foundations</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Hong Kong, I pursued Finance & Strategic Management with the same intensity I brought to fencing. Graduating in the top 5% of my class, making the Dean's List three times, and securing a $12,000/month internship at Nomura Prime Finance, I began to see how my past had uniquely prepared me for the present.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ability to function under pressure, navigate complex systems, and maintain strategic focus—all skills born from early adversity—now served as my competitive advantage. My multilingual background and cross-cultural experience opened doors in the international finance sector.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Future: AI, Impact, and Human Resilience</h2>
                    <p>
                        Today, I stand at the intersection of finance, AI, and human storytelling. The childhood pain that once threatened to define me now fuels my drive to build innovative systems and support others in their journeys.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm particularly drawn to how artificial intelligence can scale human capabilities while enhancing, rather than replacing, the uniquely human qualities of creativity, empathy, and resilience. My next chapter involves creating ventures that bridge technology and humanity, informed by both analytical precision and emotional intelligence.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lessons for Fellow Travelers</h2>
                    <p>
                        For those navigating their own adversity, I offer these insights from my journey:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Trauma creates unique strengths</strong> – The very experiences that wound us often build capacities others don't develop.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic patience pays off</strong> – The discipline to work consistently toward long-term goals eventually yields results that feel like "overnight success" to others.</li>
                        <li><strong>Find your arena</strong> – Whether fencing, finance, or another field, identify where your natural abilities and hard-earned skills create unique value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Build a portfolio life</strong> – Resist society's pressure to be just one thing; your complex background is an asset in building a multi-dimensional career.</li>
                        <li><strong>Let pain fuel purpose</strong> – Transform wounds into wisdom by using what you've overcome to create meaningful work and connections.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        My journey continues, with both achievements and ongoing challenges. But I no longer view my trauma as something to hide or overcome—it's the foundation upon which I've built a life of purpose, achievement, and increasingly, joy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we navigate an era of unprecedented technological and social change, I believe it's those who have learned to transform adversity into fuel who will be best positioned to thrive and contribute meaningfully to our collective future.
                    </p>

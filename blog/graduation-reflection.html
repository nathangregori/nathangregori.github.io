                <p class="blog-intro">
                    Four countries. Seven institutions. Five languages. My academic journey has been anything but linear, and as I stand at the threshold of graduation, I find myself reflecting on the mosaic of experiences that have shaped me.

                <h2>From Paris to Hong Kong: A Global Education</h2>
                <p>
                    My story is one of movement—across borders, cultures, and disciplines. I began my education in France, where the rigors of the French Baccalaureate taught me the value of critical thinking and eloquence. Romania introduced me to new perspectives and languages, while Hong Kong became the crucible where my ambitions and resilience were truly tested.
                </p>
                <h2>Lessons Beyond the Classroom</h2>
                <p>
                    University was more than lectures and exams. It was late-night study sessions, heated debates, and the quiet moments of self-doubt that forced me to grow. I learned to balance a demanding fencing career with academic excellence, earning scholarships and a place at the top of my department. But the real lessons were about discipline, adaptability, and the courage to reinvent myself.
                </p>
                <h2>Gratitude and Growth</h2>
                <p>
                    I am grateful for the mentors who challenged me, the friends who supported me, and the setbacks that became stepping stones. Each institution, each country, and each language added a new layer to my identity. I leave university not just with a degree, but with a toolkit for life: resilience, curiosity, and a global mindset.
                </p>
                <h2>What Comes Next?</h2>
                <p>
                    Graduation is not an end, but a beginning. I am excited to take the lessons of my academic journey into the world—whether in finance, strategy, or wherever my curiosity leads. The future is uncertain, but I am ready to meet it with open eyes and an open heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>To everyone who has been part of this journey—thank you. The best is yet to come.</em>

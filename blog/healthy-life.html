                    In a world that never slows down, finding balance is both an art and a science. Here's how I've learned to thrive—body and mind—through sport, music, and discipline.

                <h2>Discipline: The Foundation of Wellbeing</h2>
                <p>
                    My journey as a competitive fencer and pianist taught me early on that discipline is the backbone of any healthy routine. Whether it's waking up for morning training or practicing scales late into the night, consistency is key. Small, daily habits compound into big results.
                </p>
                <h2>Movement and Mindfulness</h2>
                <p>
                    Physical activity is non-negotiable. Fencing, swimming, and even hiking have kept me grounded and energized. But health isn't just physical—mindfulness, reflection, and creative outlets like music are just as important for mental wellbeing.
                </p>
                <h2>Nutrition and Rest</h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned that what you put into your body matters. Balanced meals, hydration, and adequate sleep are the unsung heroes of performance—whether in sport, academics, or life.
                </p>
                <h2>Balance, Not Perfection</h2>
                <p>
                    There's no such thing as a perfect routine. Life is unpredictable, and flexibility is part of the process. The goal is progress, not perfection. Celebrate small wins, learn from setbacks, and keep moving forward.
